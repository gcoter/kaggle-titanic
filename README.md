# Kaggle Titanic
The goal of this repository is to store the different models I tried so far for the Kaggle Titanic competition.

I tried several models and several approaches, including Feature selection and Feature engineering. 

So far, my best accuracy is 0.77512. I obtained it with Logistic Regression, without Feature selection. I still have to find how to improve it.

## Requirements
Pandas 0.18.1
scikit-learn
